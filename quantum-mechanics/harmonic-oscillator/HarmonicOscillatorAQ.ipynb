It will be useful to add to our objective function a small penalty for cases where either $\\Delta X$ or $\\Delta P$ are very large (we want to avoid this because we want to know $x$ and $p$ both pretty well and this helps the optimization because there is a subtle issue with our discretization as $\\Delta  X \\rightarrow 0$ and $\\Delta P$ gets very large).  \n",

    " Now we would like to go ahead and write $a^\\dagger$ and $a$ in the Harmonic Oscillator basis.  In this basis, what we expect to see is that both the raising and lowering operators are just above and below the diagonal respectively. To rotate an operator from the position basis into the Harmonic oscillator basis, you want to do ` v.T.conjugate() @ O @ v` for an operator `O` where `v` is the eigenstates of the simple harmonic oscillator.  Go ahead and rotate $a$, $a^\\dagger$ and $a^\\dagger a$ into the Harmonic oscillator basis and look at the top $10 \\times 10$ chunk. Does it make sense?  What are the values of the diagonal of $a^\\dagger a$"
