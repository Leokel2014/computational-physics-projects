# Numerical Solution of the Schrödinger Equation — Infinite Square Well

## Overview
Numerical solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a infinite square well potential using a finite-difference Hamiltonian and eigenvalue methods.

## Method
- Discretize the 1D spatial domain
- Approximate the second derivative using finite differences
- Construct the Hamiltonian matrix
- Solve the eigenvalue problem to obtain energy levels and eigenfunctions
- Validate by comparing with analytical solutions

## Outputs
- Energy spectrum (numerical vs analytical comparison)
- Eigenfunction plots for the lowest states

## Tools
Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)

## Notes
Coursework-based project (Quantum Mechanics).
