# Measurement of the Seebeck Coefficient

## Overview
This project presents an experimental determination of the Seebeck coefficient of a metallic conductor by measuring the thermoelectric voltage generated under an applied temperature gradient.

## Physics Background
The Seebeck effect describes the generation of an electric potential in response to a temperature difference across a material. The Seebeck coefficient is a fundamental parameter in thermoelectric physics and energy conversion applications.

## Method
- Establishment of a controlled temperature gradient along the sample
- Measurement of the thermoelectric voltage across the material
- Linear regression of voltage versus temperature difference
- Extraction of the Seebeck coefficient from the slope

## Data Analysis
Experimental data were analyzed using linear fitting techniques. Measurement uncertainties were evaluated and the resulting Seebeck coefficient was compared with reference values from the literature.

## Results
The measured Seebeck coefficient is consistent with expected values for the material within experimental uncertainty, validating the thermoelectric model.

## Tools
Arduino, LabView

## Notes
This project was developed as part of undergraduate coursework in Thermal Physics.
