# Blackbody Radiation of Wood

## Overview
This project investigates the thermal radiation emitted by wood and compares experimental observations with the theoretical blackbody radiation model.

## Physics Background
Blackbody radiation describes the spectral distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by an idealized object in thermal equilibrium. Real materials deviate from ideal behavior due to wavelength-dependent emissivity.

## Method
- Heating of a wood sample to controlled temperatures
- Measurement of emitted radiation intensity
- Comparison of experimental data with blackbody radiation curves
- Analysis of deviations due to material emissivity

## Data Analysis
Measured radiation intensities were analyzed as a function of temperature and compared with theoretical blackbody predictions. Material-dependent emissivity effects were discussed.

## Results
The experimental data exhibit qualitative agreement with blackbody radiation theory, with observable deviations attributed to the non-ideal emissivity of wood.

## Tools
Arduino, LabView

## Notes
This project was developed as part of undergraduate coursework in Thermal Physics.
