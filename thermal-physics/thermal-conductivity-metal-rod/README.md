# Thermal Conductivity of a Metal Rod

## Overview
This project experimentally determines the thermal conductivity of a metal rod using steady-state heat conduction measurements.

## Physics Background
Thermal conductivity quantifies a material’s ability to conduct heat and is governed by Fourier’s law of heat conduction. Accurate measurement requires controlled boundary conditions and precise temperature measurements.

## Method
- Establishment of a steady-state temperature gradient along the rod
- Measurement of temperature at multiple positions
- Application of Fourier’s law to compute thermal conductivity
- Evaluation of heat losses and systematic uncertainties

## Data Analysis
Temperature profiles were analyzed to determine heat flow and thermal conductivity. Experimental uncertainties were estimated and results were compared with accepted material properties.

## Results
The experimentally obtained thermal conductivity agrees with literature values within uncertainty, demonstrating the validity of the steady-state conduction model.

## Tools
Arduino, LabView

## Notes
This project was developed as part of undergraduate coursework in Thermal Physics.
