# Optical Activity in a Chiral Honey Bee Solution

## Overview
This project studies the optical activity of a chiral honey bee solution by measuring the rotation of the polarization plane of linearly polarized light passing through the medium.

## Physics Background
Chiral substances exhibit optical activity, causing rotation of the polarization direction of light. This phenomenon arises from the interaction between polarized light and asymmetric molecular structures.

## Method
- Preparation of a chiral honey bee solution
- Transmission of linearly polarized light through the sample
- Measurement of polarization rotation as a function of solution concentration
- Analysis of wavelength and concentration dependence

## Data Analysis
Polarization rotation angles were extracted from experimental measurements and analyzed to quantify optical activity. Results were interpreted in the context of chirality and molecular structure.

## Results
The experiment demonstrates clear polarization rotation consistent with optical activity. The dependence on concentration confirms the chiral nature of the solution.

## Tools
Arduino, LabView

## Notes
This project was developed as part of undergraduate coursework in Optics.
