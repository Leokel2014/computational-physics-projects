# Measurement of the Refractive Index of Air

## Overview
This project presents an experimental determination of the refractive index of air using interferometric techniques. The refractive index is measured by analyzing fringe shifts produced by changes in the optical path length.

## Physics Background
The refractive index of air depends on environmental variables such as temperature and pressure. Interferometry provides a highly sensitive method to detect small variations in optical path length and is widely used in precision optical measurements.

## Method
- Construction of an interferometric setup
- Measurement of fringe shifts as a function of temperature and/or pressure
- Conversion of fringe displacement into changes in optical path length
- Calculation of the refractive index of air and its dependence on environmental parameters

## Data Analysis
Experimental data were analyzed to extract fringe shifts and compute refractive index values. Results were compared with theoretical models describing the refractive index of air.

## Results
The measured refractive index values show agreement with theoretical predictions. The experiment demonstrates the sensitivity of interferometric methods to small optical path length variations.

## Tools
Arduino, LabView

## Notes
This project was developed as part of undergraduate coursework in Optics.
