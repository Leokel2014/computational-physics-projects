# Diffraction Patterns from Transmission Gratings

## Overview
This project investigates diffraction patterns produced by transmission gratings with different line densities. The experiment analyzes the angular distribution and intensity of diffracted light and compares measurements with diffraction theory.

## Physics Background
Diffraction gratings produce interference patterns governed by the grating equation, which relates diffraction angles to the wavelength of light and the grating line density. Such systems are fundamental in spectroscopy and optical instrumentation.

## Method
- Illumination of transmission gratings with known line densities
- Measurement of diffraction angles for multiple diffraction orders
- Analysis of intensity distributions across diffraction patterns
- Comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions

## Data Analysis
Diffraction angles and intensities were extracted from experimental measurements. The grating equation was used to validate the relationship between line density and observed diffraction patterns.

## Results
Experimental diffraction angles closely match theoretical predictions. The dependence of diffraction behavior on grating line density is clearly observed.

## Tools
Arduino, LabView

## Notes
This project was developed as part of undergraduate coursework in Optics.
