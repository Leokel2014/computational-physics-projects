# Computational Physics Projects

Selected computational and experimental physics projects developed as part of undergraduate coursework in physics.

These projects emphasize numerical methods, data analysis, and physical interpretation, with applications to quantum mechanics, optics, electromagnetism, and thermal physics.

## Topics
- Numerical solutions of the Schrödinger equation (finite differences, eigenvalue problems)
- Interferometry and diffraction
- Experimental data analysis and uncertainty estimation

## Tools
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- C++ (selected implementations)
- LaTeX (reports)

## Disclaimer
These projects were developed for coursework and are shared here to demonstrate skills and learning progress.
