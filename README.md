# Computational Physics Projects

Selected computational and experimental physics projects developed as part of undergraduate coursework in physics.

These projects emphasize numerical methods, data analysis, and physical interpretation, with applications to quantum mechanics, optics, and thermal physics.

## Topics

### Quantum Mechanics
- Numerical solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation using finite-difference methods
- Eigenvalue problems for model quantum systems (infinite square well, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom)
- Analysis of wavefunctions, energy spectra, and probability densities

### Optics
- Interferometric measurements of the refractive index of air
- Diffraction and interference from transmission gratings with variable line densities
- Optical activity and polarization effects in chiral media

### Thermal Physics
- Measurement of thermoelectric effects (Seebeck coefficient)
- Determination of thermal conductivity using steady-state heat flow
- Experimental analysis of thermal radiation and comparison with blackbody models

## Tools
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- C++ (selected implementations)
- Arduino (data acquisition and experimental control)
- LabVIEW (instrumentation and measurement interfaces)
- LaTeX (reports and documentation)

## Disclaimer
These projects were developed as part of undergraduate coursework and are shared to demonstrate skills in computational modeling, experimental analysis, and physical interpretation.
